This is a great template README.


**General actions**
-   rename the `modulename` folder
-   Ctrl+Shift+F -> replace `modulename` with the actual module name
-   Ctrl+Shift+F -> replace `username` with your user/org name
-   Ctrl+Shift+F -> replace `lord` with your default branch name (or not, `lord` is nice)

This template includes (**bold** denotes an important action):

-   GitHub Actions workflows
    -   `publish.yml` publishes a new release for every version bump in `pyproject.toml` (check out `poetry version`)
        -   **Add PYPI_TOKEN variable to repository settings** to publish package on PyPI, otherwise you will get an error (or just remove the `Publish on PyPI` step)
        -   GitHub releases are created automatically, but you need to **give the workflow write permissions (Settings / Actions / General / Workflow Permissions)**
    -   `test.yml` runs several checks on PR and on push to main branch
        -   `Check Types` job runs mypy against the module code
            -   You may want to remove `--disallow-any-expr` if you don't want errors on `Any`
        -   `Run Tests` runs tests from `test` on several Python versions folder and pushes the coverage data to Coveralls
            -   You may want to write the actual tests
            -   If you don't want Coveralls integration, just remove the `Coveralls Update` step altogether
            -   Check `python-version` matrix and edit if you want a different version list
-   Stub module folder
    - Includes an empty `__init__.py` (wow!)
    - Includes an empty `py.typed` file so that typecheckers treat your package as typed ([see PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#packaging-type-information))
    - **You may want to write actual code**
-   `.gitignore` file, taken from [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore), with `poetry.lock` added (**consider removing that line if your package is not a library**)
-   Simple `CONTRIBUTING.md` file
-   `pyproject.toml` file
    - Includes several dev dependencies (used in workflows)
    - **Be sure to edit the license, author, links and other information as needed**
-   `LICENSE` file:
    - **Be sure to replace license file if needed**
